# test to create a graph and an edge can be added between two nodes in a graph

# create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add an edge between the two nodes
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the edges from n1
graph1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1)
