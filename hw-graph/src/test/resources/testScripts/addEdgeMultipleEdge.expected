# Tests that a graph can be created, a pair of nodes and
# multiple edges between them can be added, and a pair of nodes
# and edges can be printed out.

# create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add 5 edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e3 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n2 to n1 in graph1
added edge e1 from n2 to n1 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the edges from n1
graph1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n2(e2) n2(e3)
