# test that create two graphs and add 3 nodes in graph1, 2 nodes in graph2, 1 node in graph3.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1
created graph graph2
created graph graph3

# Add a pair of nodes
AddNode graph1 n1
AddNode graph1 n2
AddNode graph1 n3
AddNode graph2 n4
AddNode graph2 n5
AddNode graph3 n6

# Print the nodes in the graphs
ListNodes graph1
