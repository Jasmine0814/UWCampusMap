# test the children of many nodes separate in two graphs can be listed.

CreateGraph A
CreateGraph B
added node n1 to A
added node n2 to A
added node n3 to A
added node n4 to B
added node n5 to B
added node n6 to B
added edge e12 from n1 to n2 in A
added edge e13 from n1 to n3 in A
added edge e45 from n4 to n5 in B
added edge e46 from n4 to n6 in B
the children of n1 in A are: n2(e12) n3(e13)
the children of n4 in B are: n5(e45) n6(e46)
