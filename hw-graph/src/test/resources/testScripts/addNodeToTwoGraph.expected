# test that create two graphs and add 3 nodes in graph1, 2 nodes in graph2, 1 node in graph3.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1
created graph graph2
created graph graph3

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1
added node n4 to graph2
added node n5 to graph2
added node n6 to graph3

# Print the nodes in the graphs
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3
graph2 contains: n4 n5
graph3 contains: n6
