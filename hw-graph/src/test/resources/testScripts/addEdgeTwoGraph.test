# test that create 2 graphs and add two pair of nodes to each graph
# and add two edge between each pair of nodes

# Create a graph
created graph graph1
created graph graph2

# Add nodes
AddNode graph1 n1
AddNode graph1 n2
AddNode graph2 n3
AddNode graph2 n4

#Add Edges
AddEdge graph1 n1 n2 e1
AddEdge graph2 n3 n4 e2

# Print the nodes in the graph and the edges from n1
ListNodes graph1
