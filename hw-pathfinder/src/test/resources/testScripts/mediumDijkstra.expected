# find the shortest path with Dijkstra's algorithm

created graph Graph1

added node A to Graph1
added node B to Graph1
added node C to Graph1
added node D to Graph1
added node E to Graph1

added edge 10.000 from B to C in Graph1
added edge 1000.010 from C to A in Graph1
added edge 750.000 from D to E in Graph1
added edge 10.000 from E to A in Graph1
added edge 20.000 from B to D in Graph1

path from B to A:
B to D with weight 20.000
D to E with weight 750.000
E to A with weight 10.000
total cost: 780.000
