# find the shortest path with Dijkstra's algorithm

created graph Graph1

added node A to Graph1
added node B to Graph1
added node C to Graph1
added node D to Graph1
added node E to Graph1

added edge 2.500 from A to B in Graph1
added edge 7.774 from B to C in Graph1
added edge 1.500 from C to D in Graph1
added edge 1.500 from D to E in Graph1
added edge 6.000 from E to A in Graph1
added edge 2.000 from D to C in Graph1
added edge 2.000 from E to D in Graph1
added edge 9.000 from D to A in Graph1

path from A to E:
A to B with weight 2.500
B to D with weight 1.211
D to E with weight 1.500
total cost: 5.211
path from E to C:
E to D with weight 2.000
D to C with weight 2.000
total cost: 4.000
